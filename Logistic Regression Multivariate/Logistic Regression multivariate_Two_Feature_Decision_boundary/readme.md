Decision Boundary For 2 Features 2-class Classifier Are Of Types:


      1. Linear Decision Boundary      { LINEAR DECISION BOUNDARY }
      2. Complex Decision Boundary     { NON -LINEAR DECISION BOUNDARY }
      3. Contour - Based Decision Boundary  ( LINEAR DECISION BOUNDARY }


NOTE : 1. Polynomial Processing Increases accuracy Of The Model As well As Helps In ploting Complex Decision Boundaries.
