ML USING PYTHON - MULTI VARIABLE - USING SCIKIT-LEARN FRAMEWORK.

NOTE:
1---> Insted of using entire data set we split our data set into training set [80% of data] and test set[20% of data] and use this training       set to train our model in Linear Regression [ Both uni and multi Varient ] to prevent over-fitting .
2---> Multi-Varient is having more accuracy that Uni-Varient.
3---> In Multi-Varient as num of features increases the over-fitting increases. Therefor try to reduce the number of features in Multi-           Varient to prevent over-fitting.
      * If Num of features is 2,Then we can plot 3d [ Plane / Hyperplane ].
      * If Num of features is>2,Then we can plot any graph Bcoz at max in Math we have 3D graphs only.
